# Open Bier

_(a.k.a. PEMbrew, Guerilla-Brewing, Home-Brew, ...we hope none of these were licensed :P)_

Open Bier is an approach to redesign the home-brewing experience. 
We want to provide everyone with everything they need to brew their very own beer, (or as the Germans say 'Bier')
both inexpensively and completely open-source.

What means open-source in this kind of sense? This project's value lies in all its possible failures,
which are either prevented by careful planning, or documented in a detailed way, both on this repository and our blog.

Our primary goal is to provide ourselfs with the very first home brewn beer, and we want to enable you to do the same
with the most low-cost tools that we can find.  
It's as easy as paying a visit to your next hardware store. At least here in Germany.

### So lets begin the challenge

The first question to answer is: What kind of beer do you want to brew?  
This is fundamental, as it influences all the other steps taken afterwards and especially the time it takes to brew this
whole thing.

Our goal in this part of the project is finding out which is the best possible approach to this problem.
This also takes into concern our time problem: At best, we want to achieve an iterative process, where we can
take the time to reflect on what has gone wrong and or what need improvement.
Which means we will need a beer that we can brew very time-efficiently.

### Getting started with the materials

This part of the project will be only about the materials and ingredients needed for brewing. We will also try to find
out where to get what for a fair price.

### Brew it!

The main part of the whole process is of course the brewing of the actual beer.
This is basically the stage where we will be putting it all together and do it. Whatever that means.

### (Possible Iteration)

If we do have enough time, we can start from fresh, which means trying to fix the problems that we are still facing.
Fail early and often! Thats what Raptor-Jesus tried to equip all of us with.
